# My Software Projects
I produce **R** packages for implementing methods that are useful for social scientists (and sometimes I create software tools [just for fun!](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=schoenberg)). Below are brief descriptions of my software projects.

## psychmeta
The `psychmeta` R package is a comprehensive implementation of the Hunter-Schmidt method of psychometric meta-analysis. It is available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=psychmeta) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/jadahlke/psychmeta) account (the latter is always the most current version because I release incremental updates on GitHub between CRAN releases). For an introduction to `psychmeta`, check out the [overview vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psychmeta/vignettes/overview.html). Visit [psychmeta.com/](http://psychmeta.com/) to learn more about `psychmeta`. 

## hlmer
The `hlmer` R package is a wrapper for the `lme4` package's `lmer` function that allows researchers to specify mixed-effects models in hierarchical notation. The output from `hlmer` is meant to mimic the output of Raudenbush, Bryk, & Congdon's *HLM7* program for Windows. `hlmer` is available from my [GitHub](https://github.com/jadahlke/hlmer) account.

## schoenberg
My first love was music, so it's only natural that I would eventually work music into my programming activities. I've produced the `schoenberg` package to offer open-source tools for creating and manipulating 12-tone (i.e., dodecaphonic) musical matrices using Arnold Schoenberg's (1923) serialism technique. This package can generate random 12-tone matrices and can generate matrices using a pre-determined sequence of notes. It is available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=schoenberg) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/jadahlke/schoenberg) account.
